# Video-Streaming-Using-Webcam-In-Flask-Web-Framework

Welcome to the README file for the "Video Streaming Using Webcam in Flask Web Framework" project. This project is a simple implementation of video streaming using the Flask web framework and the webcam on your computer.

To use this project, you will need to have Python and Flask installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install Flask by running the command "pip install Flask" in your terminal.

Once you have Python and Flask installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine by running the command "git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository-name>.git" in your terminal, or by downloading the ZIP file from the GitHub page and extracting it to your desired location.

To run the project, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the command "python app.py". This will start the Flask server and you should see a message saying "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/".

Open a web browser and go to the URL "http://127.0.0.1:5000/" to view the video stream from your webcam. If you have multiple cameras connected to your computer, you can select which camera to use by changing the index value in the line "cv2.VideoCapture(0)" in the app.py file.

That's it! You should now be able to stream video from your webcam using the Flask web framework. If you have any questions or issues with the project, feel free to open an issue on the GitHub page or contact the project owner.
